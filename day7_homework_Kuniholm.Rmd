1. Work on making progress on your Final Project.

2. Document some road blocks you are running into.

# Some of the challenges I'm finding are (still) how to manage the NAs and unique symbols (<,>, etc), and ensuring that numbers are read as integers/numeric rather than characters. 

3. Email them to me before 7am tomorrow.
